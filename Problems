Problem 1
Given an unsorted array of N elements and an element X. The task is to write a recursive function to check whether the element X is present in the given array or not.

Example:
array[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
X = 3.

The function should return True, as 3 is 
present in the array.


Solution: The idea is to compare the first element of the array with X. If the element matches with X then return True otherwise recur for the remaining part of the array.

The recursive function will somewhat look like as shown below:
// arr[] is the given array 
// l is the lower bound in the array
// r is the upper bound
// x is the element to be searched for
// l and r defines that search will be 
// performed between indices l to r

bool recursiveSearch(int arr[], int l,  
                            int r, int x) 
{ 
    if (r < l) 
        return false; 
    if (arr[l] == x) 
        return true; 
    if (arr[r] == x) 
        return true; 

    return recursiveSearch(arr, l + 1,  
                              r - 1, x); 
} 

Time Complexity: The above algorithm runs in O(N) time where N is the number of elements present in the array.
Space Complexity: There is no extra space used however the internal stack takes O(N) extra space for recursive calls.

Problem 2
Given a string, the task is to write a recursive function to check if the given string is palindrome or not.

Examples:
Input : string = "malayalam"
Output : Yes
Reverse of malayalam is also
malayalam.

Input : string = "max"
Output : No
Reverse of max is not max.


Solution: The idea to write the recursive function is simple and similar to the above problem:
If there is only one character in the string, return true.
Else compare first and last characters and recur for remaining substring.

Recursive Function:
// s and e defines the start and end index of string

bool isPalindrome(char str[], int s, int e) 
{ 
    // If there is only one character 
    if (s == e) 
        return true; 
  
    // If first and last 
    // characters do not match 
    if (str[s] != str[e]) 
        return false; 
  
    // If there are more than  
    // two characters, check if  
    // middle substring is also  
    // palindrome or not
    if (s < e) 
        return isPalindrome(str, s + 1, e - 1); 
  
    return true; 
}
